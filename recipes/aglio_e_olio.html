    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Aglio e Olio can be made with pantry staples - spaghetti, oil,
      garlic, red chilli flakes, black pepper and fresh parsley. In the
      repertoire of traditional Italian pasta dishes, there is none as simple
      and straightforward as Spaghetti aglio e olio. Its literal translation is
      <strong>garlic</strong> and <strong>olive oil</strong> which is really the
      essence of this dish which originates in <strong>Naples</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While being simple, <em>no two aglio e olio are alike</em>. It takes
      practice to make aglio e olio perfectly as the trick is about toasting the
      garlic slices to a <strong>perfect golden brown</strong> in the olive oil.
      And if you feel like wanting to give it your own kick, the options are
      endless.

    <h3>Don't be afraid, if patient no-one make aglio e olio wrong.</h3>
