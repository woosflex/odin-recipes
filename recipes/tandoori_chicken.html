    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Tandoori Chicken is a traditionally made popular indian dish which is
      heavenly tender, juicy and incredibly delicious. Historically, it was
      known as <strong>Tandoori Murgh</strong>, where tandoori means it is
      cooked in a tandoor which is a clay oven and murgh means chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is grilled to perfection in a Tandoor where the juices drip on hot
      charcoal to release a smoky flavor. The resulting char grilled chicken is
      tender and juicy with bursting flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sources say Tandoori Chicken dates back to the Mughal period. While others
      say it was invented at <strong>Moti Mahal, Peshawar</strong> by
      <strong>Kundan Lal Gujral</strong>, before the partition of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to reassure you that you do not need to be a historically famous
      cook of emperor to cook this dish or clay oven. You can still cook it
      simply with any heat source which can grill/roast such as an oven, stove
      top, air fryer or direct fire. You can infuse the smoky flavor either by
      smoking the grilled chicken with a
      <em>red hot wood coal or cook it over direct fire</em> for a few minutes
      towards the end.

      <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 &#188; cups plain yogurt</li>
      <li>&frac12; medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Coriander powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preparing Marinade</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Firstly transfer yogurt to a large mixing bowl. Add all the spice
          powders. Garam masala, coriander powder, pepper powder, turmeric,
          chili powder and salt. Also add in ginger garlic paste and kasuri
          methi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add lemon juice. Be careful to add a lot. Use as required depending on
          how sour your yogurt is.
        </li>
        <li>Pour oil as well.</li>
        <li>
          Mix well and taste the marinade. Add any ingredient needed to suit
          your taste like salt and chili powder. The marinade has to be thick
          and not runny otherwise it will stick up to the pa. Chicken will let
          out lot of moisture and juices while grilling if the marinade is
          runny.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the chicken has no dripping water. If needed wipe dry with a
          kitchen tissue. Next make deep gashes to the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Marinate it well so that the masala reaches deep inside. The marinade
          will tenderize the chicken. So make sure you do it properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours to over night. Do not
          reduce the time as the chicken will not get cooked and turn tender.
          You can keep this as long as 48 hours in the refrigerator.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Grill Tandoori Chicken</strong>
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Grilling in Oven - Preheat the oven to the highest for at least 15 to
          20 mins. In my oven it is 470 F (240 C). Place a wired rack over a
          baking tray and then place the prepared chicken over the wired rack.
          grill it for 15 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a spicy version, mix together red chilli powder with oil and baste
          the chicken on both the sides. You can also baste the left over
          marinade over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grill the chicken again for another 6 to 10 mins until fully cooked
          through. Adjust the timing as needed depending on the size of your
          chicken pieces. The last 5 mins set the oven to broil mode or move the
          rack to the top most level and grill until charred.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Stove top method - Grilling pan</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat a pan. Spread 1 to 2 tbsp oil.</li>
        <li>
          When the oil turns hot, place the chicken on the tawa (pan). Regulate
          the heat to medium.
        </li>
        <li>After 3 to 4 minutes flip the pieces. Smear the marinade.</li>
        <li>Flip them again after 3 to 4 mins</li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile add red chilli powder to a small bowl. Mix it with oil. This
          is optional. Skip if you do ont want spiced ones. Smear the mix to the
          tandoori chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn them to tother side. Cook on both sides until soft and cooked. If
          it looks too dry, smear little soft butter.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Smoke Tandoori Chicken (Optional)</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Burn the charcoal.</li>
        <li>
          When it turns hot, drop it in a cup. Immediately pour 1 to 2 tsps
          ghee.
        </li>
        <li>It will begin to smoke immediately.</li>
        <li>Finally cover it and allow to smoke for 5 to 7 mins.</li>
        <li>
          Before smoking the tandoori chicken, do check if it cooked well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Air Fryer Tandoori Chicken</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the air fryer to 390 F or 200 C. PLace the chicken on the
          basket and air fry for 10 mins on each side or until cooked through
          and the internal chicken temperatures reaches to 165 F.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once done , brush the tandoori chicken with the left over marinade or
          the red chilli paste mixed with oil. Air fry for another 2 mins. For
          the authentic flavors, brush with mustard oil or butter.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Grill in Outdoor Grill</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the outdoor grill for medium high heat.</li>
        <li>
          Grease the grate generously with oil. Wipe off the excess marinade
          from the chicken and place them over the preheated grill.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook for 5 to 6 mins and turn them the other side. Baste the marinade
          on the top side and turn it again after 5 to 6 mins. The cook time
          depends on the size of your chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          It takes about 27 to 30 mins to cook the Tandoori chicken fully.
          Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken and cook
          until it shows 165F or 75 C. Brush with some butter or mustard oil.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Serving</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Serve tandoori chicken with Cilantro Chutney or Mint Chutney alongside
          sliced onions, carrots and lemon wedges.
        </li>
